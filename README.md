## 💼 Skills & Technologies

I’m a product-minded technical leader who loves building cool stuff with kind people. I’ve worked across enterprise, SMB, and startups especially on platform and integration-heavy projects. Background includes software + systems work (networking/middleware/embedded), plus project and people leadership. I bring clarity, steady execution, and a bias toward shipping.
